## Description
This E-Commerce web application allows a user to buy or sell Star Wars merchandise. Functionality includes register/login, post a product to sell, search/filter by product name or category, add/remove items from cart, and view/post reviews with ratings. I would like to add product images and use Stripe API for payments to improve this E-Commerce web app.
